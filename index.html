				<span class="title">Experience</span>
				<p>
					Was a Mining Engineer before, but decided to make a career change, and after trying a few things finally settled on being a web developer.<br>
					Worked freelance for about a year, and have learned a lot trying to figure out code on my own. While I've become quite resourceful during this time, I've also realized that the learning process can be significantly expedited if you receive help from more then just the internet.<br>

				<span class="title">Interests</span>
				<p>
					Just to clarify (due to my choice of background image), I do not follow basketball anymore, I only did when I was a kid and Jordan was playing :)<br>
					I'm also a huge fan of Elon Musk, I like to read, watch movies, travel, play videogames, eat, and just in general have good fun.<br>
