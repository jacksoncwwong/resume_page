				<span class="title">Experience</span>
				<p>
					Was a Mining Engineer before, but decided to make a career change, and after trying a few things finally settled on being a web developer.<br>
					Worked freelance for about a year, and have learned a lot trying to learn code on my own. While I've learned to be quite resourceful on my own, I've also really learned that the process can be expedited if you received help from more then just the internet.<br>
